	<p> I was a camp counselor one summer and it was pool day. There were way too many people at the water park in my opinion (it wasn't a very big one). There were a couple of little babies running around in diapers. Well... I stepped in something that I thought at the time was a bit of food. Without realizing what it was, my initial "Ew gross!" reaction was to put my foot in the pool, as there wasn't anything else nearby. (Bad I know.) The odor hit me when I was washing my foot off. It was definitely poop. Poop- on the pool deck. The worst part was that by the time I got the lifeguard to clean it up, there were so many damn people at the pool that the poop was no longer there. Literally gone because people had stepped in it along the way. Stepping in poop sucks. Never swam in that pool ever again. </p>
