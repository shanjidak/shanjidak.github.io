	<p> You and your friends walk past an outdoor pool for a day care. There are way too many people at the pool in your opinion (it wasn't a very big one). There are little babies running around in diapers. Well... in front of the gate you step in something that you think is a bit of food. Without realizing what it was, your initial "Ew gross!" reaction is to rub your foot against the gate, as there isn't anything else nearby. (Bad you know.) The odor hits you when you lift your foot. It is definitely poop. Poop- on the sidewalk. The worst part is that by the time you get someone from the daycare to clean it up, there are so many damn people at the pool that they have stepped on it too. You can hardly even see it anymore because people have stepped in it along the way. Stepping in poop sucks. You will never walk near that pool ever again. </p>
