	<p> When you were a child, in your backyard there were these beautiful green bugs. They had these beautiful, huge eyes. Your family told you if you touched the tiny tail you would die, and you were terrified even though tempted to touch them. You knew they were likely not telling the truth, but you still couldn't bring yourself to do it. But there was something magical and beautiful about them in your childhood and you loved them. You see the same bugs outside during your gym class. Then as you are...walking on the grass with your friend....they point at your foot. You lift your foot, and underneath is one of the green bugs. Squashed, dying or dead. You are so upset at the thought of one of the revered Green Bugs actually dying and feel a great deal of disgust for yourself. This was the beginning of the end of the magic for you of those strange creatures, that you only remembered seeing in your family garden in the past. But, fond memories. </p>
