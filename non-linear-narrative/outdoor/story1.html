	<p> When I was a child, in our family there were these beautiful green bugs. They had these beautiful, huge eyes. My older sisters, being older sisters, told me if you touched the tiny tail you would die, and I was terrified even though tempted...I knew they were likely not telling the truth, but I still couldn't bring myself to do it. But there was something magical and beautiful about them in my childhood and we all loved them. Then one day...walking down the driveway with my sister....her screams. She lifted her foot, and underneath was one of the Green Bugs. Squashed, dying or dead. I was so upset at the thought of one of the revered Green Bugs actually dying and the disgust and pity for my sister. That may have been the beginning of the end of the magic to me of those strange creatures, that I only remember seeing in my family garden at all. But fond memories. </p>
