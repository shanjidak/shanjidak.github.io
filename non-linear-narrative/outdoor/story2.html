		<p> Near your school there is a large pond that everyone goes to at the end of class. As you walk there with your friends, you suddenly feel something squishing and bursting under your foot. You looked under your foot and see a crushed 4-5 inch black slug. The feeling of it is one of the most disgusting sensations you have ever felt. </p>
		<p style="text-align:center"> After you tell your friends of the horrifying situation, they offer to take you out to the city as a distraction. </p>
