		<h2 style="text-align:center "> "Good shoes take you good places." It is a saying known by many. But, you can't always control what your "good" shoes will encounter. That is why you get to control what my shoes will encounter. As I go through my daily routine, you decide how my story will flow. With every choice you make, you will get to read a story from from a real person about what their shoes have encountered. Once you reach the end of the day, you will develop a bizarre adventure for my shoes. Start by picking a pair of shoes for school. </h2>
