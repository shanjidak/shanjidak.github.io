A sneaker sits in the dark. As it sloely begins to see the night, it moves from where it is sitting on to the right foot of a human body. It's laces are tightened and tied together with two loops. The sneaker begins to move at a steady pace. It goes down a set of wooden steps. It walks on a dirty sidewalk alongside other forms of footwear. The bottom of the sneaker is stuck. It had been placed on top of recently chewed gum. With every step, the sneaker sticks to the sidewalk. The sneaker goes back up the wooden steps. A sharp tool scrapes the gum off of the bottom of the sneaker. The sneaker is placed again in the dark, until the next day.
