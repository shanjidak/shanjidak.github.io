		<p> You are in school working on a project where you have to create the solar system out of these large Styrofoam balls that you brought from your local hobby store. You were pinning toy plastic trees on the planet earth using thumbtacks that you kept in a glass jar. You are working on it at your desk when the jar falls off the table and shatters on the floor. Your reaction is to go run and tell somebody. Thumbtacks and Glass. All over the soles of your shoes, and your arms once you fall on the ground. Fun times. </p>
