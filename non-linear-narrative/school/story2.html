		<p style="text-align:center"> I was probably about 10 years old and I was doing a school project creating the solar system out of these large Styrofoam balls that you buy at any hobby store. I was pinning toy plastic trees on the planet earth using thumbtacks that my mom kept in a glass jar. I was by myself on the kitchen table working on it when the jar falls off the table and breaks on the floor. My 10 year old reaction was to go run and tell my mom. Thumbtacks. and Glass. All over my feet, and both arms once I fell on the ground. Fun times. </p>
