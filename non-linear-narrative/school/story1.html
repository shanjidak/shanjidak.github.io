		<p style="text-align:center"> You had a project due today, so you came in carrying a toothpick bridge for class. In your hand you carried a box of the unassembled toothpicks. Someone pushes you in the hallway on your way to class and you drop the box. Scattered all over the ground of a crowded hallway are your toothpicks. You take one step and hear a crack. You look below your shoe and see that you stepped on a toothpick that was sticking up and broke in half, causing the other half to get stuck in your shoe. After gathering your toothpick, you end up using the fork from your lunch to pry out the toothpick like you would with a hammer and nail. </p>
