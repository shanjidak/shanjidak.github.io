	<p> Your female family member goes out later in the evening and when you go in the dark to start your night routine, you step right on her freshly bloodied period panties on the floor. Apparently she didn't know she had her period and just left them on the bathroom floor... you spend hours cleaning blood off the tiles because she was already gone. </p>
