	<p> My sister got ready earlier in the morning than me and when I got up in the dark to start my morning routine I stepped right on her freshly bloodied period panties on my floor. Apparently she didn't know she had it and just left them hanging out in front of my dresser... Spent hours cleaning blood out of the carpet because she was already gone. </p>
