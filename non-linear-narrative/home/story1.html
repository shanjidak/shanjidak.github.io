	<p> You are in the middle of building your Lego Death Star when you get an important phone call. Your phone is too far from you, so you run with the Lego Death Star in order to recieve the call in time. You end up dropping it, but continue running so you step on it with both feet, full force on 4000 pieces. You panic and try to step off but when you shift all your weight to one foot, you can't take it and switch feet, essentially stomp/hopping rapidly on the pile like 10 times before you lose your balance and fall onto the pile. You tried to stop the fall by stretching out your arms but just fall on top of them, crush them into the pile of Legos. This was a collective 7 seconds of hell. You deicide to never rebuild that set. </p>
	<p style="text-align:center"> You decide to leave the mess after your phone call and just head to bed. </p>
