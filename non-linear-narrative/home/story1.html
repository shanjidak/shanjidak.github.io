	<p> I was once running with a Lego Death Star. I dropped it but continued running so I step with both feet, full force on 4000 pieces. From the pain I panicked and tried to step off but when I shifted all my weight to one foot I couldn't take it and had to switch feet, essentially stomp/hopping rapidly on the pile like 10 times before I lost my balance and fell onto the pile. I tried to stop the fall by stretching out my arms but just fell on top of them, crush them into the pile of Legos. As a 10 year old this was a collective 7 seconds of hell. I never rebuilt that set and never will. </p>
