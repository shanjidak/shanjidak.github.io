						<h6> ABOUT THIS BLOG </h6>
						<p> This blog explores this larger umbrella of direct behavioral design and analyzes how it may be replacing what we currently know as user centered design. I am interested in the intentions behind interactive design and designing the user experience. I see user experience design as a field that is changing rapidly with the evolution of technology. The new generation of designers are forming opinions on how one should design for a user and I believe this is setting the groundwork for a whole new era of interactive design. Rather than designing around what a user is familiar with, interactive design will anticipate the user’s actions and will use it to induce a direct behavioral change. Using this approach, users may take away much more from their experience and become more conscious of how they are interacting. </p>
